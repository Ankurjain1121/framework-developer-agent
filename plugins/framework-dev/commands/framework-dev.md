# Framework Developer Orchestrator

I'll help you plan your project through 6 phases, creating comprehensive blueprint files at each step:

## Phases Overview

| Phase | Name | Deliverables |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **1** | Discovery | Vision, outline, architecture diagrams |
| **2** | Structure | Module hierarchy, dependencies, risks |
| **3** | Planning | API contracts, coding sequence |
| **4** | Agents | LLM assignments, tailored prompts |
| **5** | Execution | Handoffs, progress tracking |
| **6** | Integration | Final report, deployment checklist |

## Key Principles

- **Research-backed** - Every recommendation has sources
- **Approval gates** - You approve each phase before continuing
- **Blueprint files** - All decisions documented in `.framework-blueprints/`
- **Resumable** - Can continue from any checkpoint
- **Multi-agent** - Optimizes work division across LLMs

## Getting Started

$ARGUMENTS

### If starting a new project:
Tell me about your project:
- **What problem does it solve?**
- **Who will use it?**
- **What are the core features?**

### If resuming:
I'll check for `.framework-blueprints/00-project-state.json` to find your previous session.

## Blueprint Structure Created

```
.framework-blueprints/
├── 00-project-state.json     # Resume from here
├── 01-discovery/             # Outlines, diagrams, decisions
├── 02-structure/             # Module breakdown, dependencies
├── 03-api-planning/          # API contracts, coding sequence
├── 04-agent-assignment/      # LLM assignments, prompts
├── 05-execution/             # Handoffs, progress tracking
└── 06-integration/           # Final report, checklists
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Start new project
/framework-dev I want to build a task management app for remote teams

# Resume previous session
/framework-dev resume

# Start with specific focus
/framework-dev Build an e-commerce platform with offline-first mobile app
```
